## DISCLAIMER ##

This project is in its early days, everything you see here is almost a POC. I will constantly be changing this project and adding / removing features. As said below, suggestions are greatly appreciated and assist me in prioritising feature addition. 

## About The Project

After trying to make-do with a handful of asset discovery tools, I decided that it was time to just create something that does what I want, how I want it. This is an ongoing project and features are prone to change / deletion. I'm taking any/all suggestions and code additions that assist in creating a tool that can compete with it's predecessors. 

It's mainly written in python, but I'm planning on adding a website / report function, which will use markup languages. So contact me if you're confident with HTML / JS, etc..

## Built With

Python3

## Getting Started

Disclaimer: Afaik, one of the libraries I use downloads a 100mb chromium package during use somewhere. It only does it once, but just ensure that you have the space for that prior to running this.

If you clone this repository with sudo, ensure that you run the program as sudo also, it will break the file read/write functions otherwise.

This is how you currently install and run this program:

### Prerequisites

```sh
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

```

3. Run the program, it will do an initial installation.

```sh

./run.py
```

## Usage
